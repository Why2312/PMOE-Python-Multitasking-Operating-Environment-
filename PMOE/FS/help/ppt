ppt:
PPT (PMOE Package Tool) is a tool designed to download packages speciffically made for PMOE. It grabs the packages off of pmoe-software.com, and installs the packages.
Packages can have dependencies and descriptions, which allow them to be versatile. 
They also have an 8MB limit to prevent a large package hogging all of the space, but it ignores the dependencies sizes.

ppt <action> <package>

ppt install test
ppt remove test
