## Reporting a Vulnerability

To report a vulnerability, you should open an issue.
The issue has to document where the vulnerability is found, how it works, steps to replicate, and possible ways to patch it.
If there is a vulnerability in an old, still supported version, it might take longer for the vulnerability to be patched.
