# PMOE
PMOE (Python Multitasking Operating Environment) is my second attempt at making an operating environment for terminals.


# Website
The website for PMOE is available here: http://pmoe-software.com
The website usually goes down for maintenence, but it is online most of the day.

## What is PMOE?
PMOE is a python program that was created with the intention to help users with multitasking and operating environments in python.
## Is it safe?
PMOE is a terminal like operating environment with the <a href="https://www.nano-editor.org/">GNU Nano editor</a> as its file editor.
PMOE is safe as long as you do not send delete commands to any important files of yours, so I strongly recommend putting PMOE in its own drive/folder,
to prevent such issues. If you are wary of you accidentally deleting your files, PMOE might not be for you. 
## How big is it?
PMOE itself is less than a MiB in size as a compressed zip file, and less than 2 MiB in size uncompressed. But if you count the python interpreter
and libraries, it is closer to ~80MiB.
## Where can I download it?
By Going to the website, then doing to the downloads, or by downloading the latest release, you can quickly decompress the zip file and start bios.py
## Is it for me?
This operating environment is made for developers on python. As of version 5.9.0, it is in a state where a developer can code their own commands
and programs as they wish.
